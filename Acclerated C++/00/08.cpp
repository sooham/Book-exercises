// Is the program valid?

#include <iostream>
int main()

    // This is a comment that extends over several lines
    // by using // at the beginning of each line instead of using /*
    // or */ to delimite comments.
    std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl;

}

// Valid. A multiline comment in a singline line comment is fine
// as are nested single line comments
