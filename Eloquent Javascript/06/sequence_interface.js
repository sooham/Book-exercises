/* Design an interface that abstracts iteration over a collection of values.
 * An object that provides this interface represents a sequence,
 * and the interface must somehow make it possible for code that uses
 * such an object to iterate over the sequence, looking at the element values
 * it is made up of and having some way to find out when the end of the
 * sequence is reached.
